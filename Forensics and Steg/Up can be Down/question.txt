Mr. Robot is being sent to future. But accidently he lost his passkey which he needs to activate the Time Machine. But he is smart and had already asked Elliot to save the key inside a file to use it in such conditions but safely so that others can't retrieve it easily. Can you help Mr. Robot to find the secret passkey from the file?
