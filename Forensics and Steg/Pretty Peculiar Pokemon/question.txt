Ash is on his mission to become world's best pokemon master. On his way he finds an amazing pokemon named charlizard, which he intends to catch in his pokeball. But he finds out that the last pokeball he had was missing. Maybe some pokemon took it. Can you help ash to find that hidden pokemon to get his pokeball back?
Here's a file you will need on this mission. 
But try to find the perfect path, it can be a "timewaste", i assure you.
