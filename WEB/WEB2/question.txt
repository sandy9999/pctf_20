An user named "CruSieg" is posting messages in support of Terrorism in a famous social media platform. 
He has setup his Home Photography Studio where he works on posts and images with his own camera and personal 
computer to keep his identity anonymous. 
But luckily we have captured some traffic packets that contains some 
data that might be useful.But then we couldnt get his login credentials.Can you login as CrueSieg and remove 
all the posts and images before its too late?
